# qd-python

This library is an open source software package with utility functions regarding
engineering, especially Simulation and Computer Aided Engineering (CAE).
The library is still young, so features drop in over time depending on the
persons who contribute. Visit our website at http://www.qd-eng.de/.

CAE suffers greatly from expensive tools with bad or moderate scripting access.
Also many algorithms developed in research never get published due to licensing
or being very specific regarding a certain software environment. Engineering is
lacking this attitude in contrary to modern informatics.

We want to tackle this issue with this free library, in order to give engineering
a boost. Use it, build more awesome applications with it, share your projects
too and if possible cotribute.
